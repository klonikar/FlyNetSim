RcvPacket:
The code above is a function called RcvPacket that receives a packet and an address as input parameters. The function starts by allocating memory for a buffer to store the packet data. It then copies the data from the packet to the buffer and converts it to a string. The function also creates a timestamp and appends it to the end of the string.
The function then checks the fourth character of the string to determine the type of packet received. If the packet is a control command packet from the ground control station (GCS) to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the function publishes the message to a message queue using ZeroMQ. The function also tokenizes the string to extract the ingress and egress times of the packet and calculates the network delay. If the elapsed time since the last calculation is greater than one second, the function prints the average network delay for command packets.
If the packet is a telemetry packet from the UAV to the GCS, the function publishes the message to a different message queue using ZeroMQ. If the packet is a sensor packet, the function receives messages from a ZeroMQ subscriber until it finds a message with a timestamp greater than the timestamp of the received packet. Once it finds a message with a greater timestamp, the function publishes the message to the telemetry message queue.
Finally, the function frees the memory allocated for the timestamp and the string buffer and deletes the buffer.

RcvPktTrace:
The code above defines a function called RcvPktTrace that connects a callback function RcvPacket to a trace source. The trace source is defined using the Config::ConnectWithoutContext method, which takes a string argument that specifies the trace source to connect to and a callback function to call when the trace source is triggered.
In this case, the trace source is specified using a wildcard pattern that matches all nodes and applications in the simulation. The pattern /NodeList/*/ApplicationList/*/$ns3::PacketSink/Rx matches all nodes in the simulation that have an application with a PacketSink object that receives packets. The Rx suffix specifies that the trace source is triggered when a packet is received by the PacketSink.
The MakeCallback method is used to create a callback object that calls the RcvPacket function when the trace source is triggered. The RcvPacket function is responsible for processing the received packet and performing any necessary actions based on the packet type.
Overall, this code sets up a trace source to monitor packet reception in the simulation and connects a callback function to the trace source to handle received packets. This is a common technique used in network simulations to monitor and analyze network traffic.

rcvCommands:
This code defines a function called `rcvCommands` that receives commands from an external application and sends them to specific UAV apps. The function takes a void pointer as an argument and casts it to a vector of pointers to `MyApp` objects. The size of the vector is used to determine the number of UAV apps that will receive commands.
The function then creates a ZeroMQ subscriber socket and connects it to a TCP endpoint on the local machine. The socket subscribes to all messages by setting the subscription filter to an empty string. After a brief sleep, the function enters an infinite loop that receives messages from the subscriber socket.
Each message is received as a ZeroMQ message and converted to a C-style string. The current simulation time is appended to the end of the string as a fixed-width string. The function then extracts the index of the UAV app from the message and uses it to retrieve the corresponding `MyApp` object from the vector.
The function then schedules the `SendMsg` method of the `MyApp` object to be called at a future time using the NS-3 simulator. The message string and the socket associated with the `MyApp` object are passed as arguments to the `SendMsg` method.
Finally, the function cleans up the ZeroMQ subscriber socket and returns 0.
Overall, this code is responsible for receiving commands from an external application and forwarding them to specific UAV apps. It uses ZeroMQ for message passing and NS-3 for scheduling. The code is well-organized and easy to read, with clear variable names and comments. However, it could be improved by adding error handling for the ZeroMQ socket and by using a more efficient data structure than a vector for storing the `MyApp` objects.

rcvTelemetry:
This code defines a function called rcvTelemetry that receives telemetry data from UAVs and forwards it to a ground control station (GCS) application. The function takes a void pointer as an argument and casts it to a vector of pointers to MyApp objects. The size of the vector is used to determine the number of UAV apps that will send telemetry data.
The function then creates a ZeroMQ publisher socket and binds it to a TCP endpoint on the local machine. The function also creates a ZeroMQ subscriber socket and connects it to a TCP endpoint on the local machine. The socket subscribes to all messages by setting the subscription filter to an empty string. After a brief sleep, the function enters an infinite loop that receives messages from the subscriber socket.
Each message is received as a ZeroMQ message and converted to a C-style string. The current simulation time is appended to the end of the string as a fixed-width string. The function then checks if the message contains sensor data and, if so, publishes it to the ZeroMQ publisher socket.
The function then extracts the index of the UAV app from the message and uses it to retrieve the corresponding MyApp object from the vector. The function then schedules the SendMsg method of the MyApp object to be called at a future time using the NS-3 simulator. The message string and the socket associated with the MyApp object are passed as arguments to the SendMsg method.
If the message is not a sensor data message, the function checks if it contains location data. If it does, the function extracts the current x and y coordinates of the UAV and updates its mobility model accordingly. If the message is a normal telemetry message, the function sends it to the GCS application using the SendMsg method of the corresponding MyApp object.
Finally, the function cleans up the ZeroMQ publisher and subscriber sockets and returns 0.
Overall, this code is responsible for receiving telemetry data from UAVs and forwarding it to a ground control station application. It uses ZeroMQ for message passing and NS-3 for scheduling. The code is well-organized and easy to read, with clear variable names and comments. However, it could be improved by adding error handling for the ZeroMQ sockets and by using a more efficient data structure than a vector for storing the MyApp objects.


The main code:
This code appears to be part of a C++ program that sets up a simulation environment using the NS-3 network simulator framework. The program simulates communication between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and a ground control station (GCS) over different network technologies (Wi-Fi and LTE). Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The code starts with the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. It takes command-line arguments `argc` and `argv` but doesn't use them.
2. Several variables are defined to store simulation parameters, such as the number of UAVs (`nUAV`), the type of network (`network_type`), the number of contending nodes (`nCong`), the input congestion rate (`inputCongRate`), and packet size (`congPktSize`). The `congRate` variable stores a string representation of the congestion rate, although the actual rate is later converted from `inputCongRate`.
3. Configuration parameters for the NS-3 simulator are set using the `GlobalValue::Bind` and `Config::SetDefault` functions. These parameters specify the simulator implementation type, TCP socket segment size, and other default settings.
4. The code binds ZeroMQ publisher sockets (`publisherCm` and `publisherTm`) to specific IP addresses and ports for communication.
5. Input parameters are loaded from an XML file using a custom `MyInput` class. These parameters include the number of UAVs, network type, number of contending nodes, traffic rate, and traffic size.
6. Information from the XML file is printed to the console for reference.
7. Depending on the `network_type` (0 for Wi-Fi, 1 for LTE), the code sets up either a Wi-Fi or LTE network environment.
   - For Wi-Fi, it creates nodes for UAVs and contending traffic nodes and sets their positions using mobility models.
   - For LTE, it configures LTE network parameters, creates eNodeB nodes, and sets up LTE devices for UAVs and contending traffic nodes.
8. The code configures the physical layer, propagation models, and other parameters for both Wi-Fi and LTE networks.
9. It sets up data transfer applications for telemetry and control based on the chosen network technology. This involves creating TCP sockets, defining the communication endpoints, and starting data transfer.
10. If the network type is Wi-Fi, it also sets up applications for sending congestion traffic with configurable rates.
11. Separate threads are created for receiving telemetry and control commands using the `pthread_create` function.
12. The program connects to a ZeroMQ subscriber socket and subscribes to incoming messages.
13. The simulation environment is scheduled to run for a specified duration.
14. Several functions are scheduled to run at specific times during the simulation, including `RcvPktTrace`.
15. The simulation is started using `Simulator::Run`, and when it's done, the results are cleaned up using `Simulator::Destroy`.
The code primarily focuses on configuring the simulation environment, setting up communication between UAVs and the GCS, and managing telemetry and control traffic. It is designed for network simulation purposes and makes use of the NS-3 framework for network modeling and simulation.

This code is written in C++ and is used for simulating a UAV network. The code is divided into different sections, each of which is responsible for a specific task. The first section is responsible for setting up the application. It checks the network type and sets up the uplink data transfer for telemetry accordingly. If the network type is 0, it sets up the uplink data transfer for telemetry using WiFi. If the network type is 1, it sets up the uplink data transfer for telemetry using LTE. It then sets up the downlink data transfer for control commands. If the network type is 0, it sets up the downlink data transfer for control commands using WiFi. If the network type is 1, it sets up the downlink data transfer for control commands using LTE. Finally, it sets up the uplink data transfer for congestion.
The second section creates pub sub threads. It creates two threads, one for receiving commands and the other for receiving telemetry. It then connects to a subscriber and sets the subscriber options.
The third section prints the current simulation time and schedules the receive packet trace function. It then stops the simulator and destroys it.
To improve the readability of the code, the developer can add comments to explain the purpose of each section and each line of code. Additionally, the developer can use meaningful variable names to make the code more understandable. To improve the performance of the code, the developer can optimize the data transfer rates and packet sizes to reduce the network load.
